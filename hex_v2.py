Process of the game:
0. Iterate over Idents
1. a: If an ident is in a head on collision with another ident, it flips in place
   b: Else, move the ident forward into the next hex
2. Resolve collisions. For hexes that contain multiple idents...
   a: If it has an ident of opposite direction in that hex, bounce off/reverse direction
   b: Else, take the average of all other idents EXCEPT SELF, but break ties by using the opposite ident of self
